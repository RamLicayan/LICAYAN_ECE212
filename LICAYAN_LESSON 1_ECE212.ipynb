    "\n",
    "The goal of this coursepack is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python. At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately."

    "## Activity\n",
    "1. Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today since we are now living in an era where technologies are geared towards automation and digitalization.An example of this is the way we learn in this time of the pandemic.We are now learning through online modalities, if you have no knowledge in the usage of computer programs, it would be a big disadvantage in your part since most of the activities are done online.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. If you were able to learn computer program, what program will you code? Why? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    *I would code a program that would serve as an all around engineering calculator because based on experience as an engineering student there is no single app or program that can automatically solve an engineering problem and show its solutions, it's either you need to download a lot of programs that takes up a lot of space on your devices. In order to know the steps of solving an engineering problem you need to search the whole internet just to find a simillar problem with a paid solution. As a student, I don't have enough budget to subscribe on a premium version of Chegg so creating an all around engineering calculator would really make a change and make learning more efficient.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What would be your pirmary motivation in learning programming?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *My primary motivation in learning programming is my interest in IoT or Internet of Things.I am very fascinated by the idea of IoT and having deep understanding in programming is a must in this field. I can see that IoT is the thing of the future and it is the key in improving our quality of life.The most notable example of IoT is the Smart Home where IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.Its long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off. Through IoT, we can live a life like Tony Stark in our own smart homes.\n",

    "## Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Python is commonly used in scientific computing due to various reasons, one of this is that Python is a relatively easy to write compared to other programming languages.Also due to Python's readablity, it would save time and avoid confusion in the syntax itself.Python is also open-source and has a large community of experts that can help you in your programming especially if there is something that you want to achieve with your code.Due to its constantly growing community, the libraries are also being continually developed which makes coding more efficient and fast.Python is frequently used in high-performance scientific applications due to the high performance nature of this programming language. Some of the common libraries used are: SciPy,NumPy and Matplotlib.SciPy is a Python library that utilizes NumPy arrays as the core data structure, and comes with various modules that are useful for widely used tasks in scientific computing, which includes algebra, integral calculus, differential equations, and signal processing.Speaking of NumPy, it is a part of the SciPy project that is released as a separate library so that those people who only need the basic requirements can use NumPy without installing the whole SciPy library.Last is the Matplotlib which is a versatile plotting library for making dynamic 2D and 3D plots which can also be stored as handwriting info. The API resembles in several respects that of MATLAB, easing the transition of MATLAB users to Python. A variety of instances, along with the source code to replicate them, are available in the matplotlib gallery. This really proves the accessibility of Python, thus making it suitable for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If Python can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for? \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Although Python is suitable for scientific computing, there are also some disadvantages.One of this is the fact that the Python code is executed line by line.This means Python has a slow execution speed and if your project requires fast execution speeds, then Python isn't applicable for your project.\n",
