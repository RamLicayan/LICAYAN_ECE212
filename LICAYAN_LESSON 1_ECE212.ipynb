    "The goal of this coursepack is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python. At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately."

    "1. Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today since we are now living in an era where technologies are geared towards automation and digitalization.An example of this is the way we learn in this time of the pandemic.We are now learning through online modalities, if you have no knowledge in the usage of computer programs, it would be a big disadvantage in your part since most of the activities are done online.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. If you were able to learn computer program, what program will you code? Why? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    *I would code a program that would serve as an all around engineering calculator because based on experience as an engineering student there is no single app or program that can automatically solve an engineering problem and show its solutions, it's either you need to download a lot of programs that takes up a lot of space on your devices. In order to know the steps of solving an engineering problem you need to search the whole internet just to find a simillar problem with a paid solution. As a student, I don't have enough budget to subscribe on a premium version of Chegg so creating an all around engineering calculator would really make a change and make learning more efficient.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. What would be your pirmary motivation in learning programming?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *My primary motivation in learning programming is my interest in IoT or Internet of Things.I am very fascinated by the idea of IoT and having deep understanding in programming is a must in this field. I can see that IoT is the thing of the future and it is the key in improving our quality of life.The most notable example of IoT is the Smart Home where IoT devices are a part of the larger concept of home automation, which can include lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems and camera systems.Its long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off. Through IoT, we can live a life like Tony Stark in our own smart homes.\n",

    "## Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Since the time of the first commercially available programming language which they called FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation),which was developed in 1956, programming really leads mankind towards the future. Through programming languages we were able to communicate to our computers and let them compute complex equations that helped us achieve countless feats like launching a man to the moon.In our time today, among the programming languages, Python is considered as one of the most well known and popular programing languages.Python is most applicable programming language to be used in scientific computing because of these reasons:\n",
    "   *Python has built-in support for scientific computing. Most Python distributions include the SciPy ecosystem (open source) which includes SciPy (a SciPy library), a numerical computation package called NumPy, and multiple independent toolkits, each known as a Scikits. Matplotlib, a 2D plotting library for visualization, is also part of the SciPy ecosystem. Matplotlib is much like MATLAB in terms of its functionality and usage but is open source.\n",
    "    *Python has bridges to MATLAB or Octave. Python can install the MATLAB Engine API so that Python programs can call MATLAB as a computational engine. MATLAB programs can also call Python functions with some limitations. Some distributions of Python may use Python packages such as Pymatbridge, which can support both MATLAB and Octave and allows the use of MATLAB within Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "    *Python is a highly extensible language. Developers have used Python wrappers for C/C++ programs for many years. Python uses the C Foreign Function Interface for Python (cFFI) to interact directly with C code. Tools such as SWIG make this easy to accomplish. Developers can also call Fortran subroutines from Python by using the Fortran to Python interface generator package, F2Py, which is now a part of NumPy.\n",
    "    *Python has very good input/output (I/O) options. Until recently, Fortran I/O has traditionally been records based. In contrast, Python has long supported multiple options for I/O and many additional packages to support all types of I/O formats, including real-time and streaming formats.\n",
    "    *Python has strong support for task automation. Python’s built-in scripting features and multiple packages have strong support for task automation. Automation of repetitive tasks and performing data logging are easy and takes little effort.\n",
    "    *Python can use a web front end. Python packages such as Django and Flask make it possible to develop and use Python as an API with a web front end. This functionality is particularly useful when using a cloud-based infrastructure as a platform to access high-performance computing (HPC) back ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If Python can build anything, where do you think Python is not applicable for? \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Although Python can build anything, there are also some disadvantages. Python has slow execution speed, which means it works with an interpreter, and not with a compiler. This means that is executes slower than C, C++, Java and many other languages. Second, it has large memory consumption, hence it is not suitable to use for development under limited memory restirction. Third, it is not suitable for Mobile and Game development due to the consumption of more memory and its slow processing speed compared to other programming languages. Fourth, it is difficult to test, since it is an interpreter based language, it is tough to run tests on code written in Python."
